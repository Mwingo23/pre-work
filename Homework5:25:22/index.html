    <p id="para1">Hello everyone! My name is Mahasin Wingo. Born and raised in New Jersey. I was employed with Newark Public Schools for 7 years as a Personal Aide working with the medically fragile and autistic population. I collaborated with teachers, case managers, and therapists to ensure we met I.E.P (Individualized Education Plan) goals. On my spare time I'm a photographer not on social media in the  process of rebranding.Currently employed with Fedex Express as a package handler. Software Engineering is a field I've always wanted to pursue.  Again thanks to Per Scholas for giving me the opportunity to pursue a new a career path towards becoming a Software Engineer and I look forward to the next 15 challenging weeks with you all.</p>
